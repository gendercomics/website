Anke Feuchtenberger was born in Berlin (GDR) in 1963. She studied at the Berlin School of Art and Design and has been teaching in the Design Department of the Hamburg University of Applied Sciences since 1997. In 2020 she received the Max und Moritz Award for her life’s work. Her most recent comic, _Genossin Kuckuck. Ein deutsches Tier im deutschen Wald_ (2023), was nominated for the German Book Prize.

This charcoal drawing, which Anke Feuchtenberger published in the 2008 volume _wehwehweh.superträne.de_, depicts a figure with a dotted headscarf, which appears in other works by Feuchtenberger—here with an ironic twist and in a superhero pose in an allusion to the title. As is characteristic of Feuchtenberger’s comics, she is playing with the relationship between the verbal and pictorial levels.
