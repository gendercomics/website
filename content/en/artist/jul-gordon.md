Jul Gordon lives in Hamburg and works as a comic artist. Her latest book _Der Frischkäse ist im 1. Stock / same position different situation_ was published in 2023 as a collaboration between the publishers Colorama (Berlin) and Edition Moderne (Zurich).

The comic shown here was created as part of the program for the dance piece _She Legend_ by Lisa Rykena and Carolin Jüngst, which premiered in 2019. In the comic, Jul Gordon addresses the theme of the play, superheroes, their media staging and fetishization, but also their queer potential, and takes a critical and ironic approach to questions of gender stereotypes and nonconformity (https://www.julgordon.de/she-legend).
