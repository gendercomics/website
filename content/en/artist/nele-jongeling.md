The iIllustrator and comic artist Nele Jongeling studied communication design and storytelling in Düsseldorf and Brussels. Her work is mostly autobiographical and explores topics such as feminism, gender, and sexuality. Her latest graphic novel _Emil:ia_ was published in late 2022 and deals with her own gender detransition. In addition to her work as an illustrator, she advocates for the visibility and support of detransitioners, holds workshops and readings, and is always working on new comic projects.

The autobiographically inspired comic _Detransition_ shown here, which Nele Jongeling first published on her Instagram account, centers on the experiences of a detrans person. Using clear language and visualizing the body in a seemingly abstract way, the comic addresses topics such as gender dysphoria, trauma, and the path to self-empowerment \([https://www.instagram.com/nelejongeling/]).
