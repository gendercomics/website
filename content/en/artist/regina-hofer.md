Regina Hofer was born in Linz in 1976 and studied graphic art at the Mozarteum in Salzburg and painting and graphic art at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna. She works as a freelance artist in the fields of drawing and animation. Most recently, she and Leopold Maurer published the comic _F22.0_ (2022).

The excerpt shown here from the comic _Blad_, first published in 2008 under the pseudonym Borretsch and then in 2018 by Luftschacht Verlag under Regina Hofer’s name, deals with eating disorders and experiences of violence in childhood and adolescence. Through her use of abstraction, she also addresses the question of the representability and perception of bodies—a central theme in eating disorders.
