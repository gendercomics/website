Ulli Lust, born in Vienna in 1967, studied graphic design at the Kunsthochschule Berlin-Weissensee. In addition to her work as a comic artist, she teaches drawing and comics at Hanover University of Applied Sciences and Arts. In 2009 she published the autobiographical graphic novel _Heute ist der letzte Tag vom Rest deines Lebens_ (Today Is the Last Day of the Rest of Your Life, 2013), for which she won numerous awards. She also runs the screencomic publisher _electrocomics_ (https://electrocomics.de/).

The excerpt shown here is from Ulli Lust’s autobiographical graphic novel _Heute ist der letzte Tag vom Rest deines Lebens_ (2009; eng. Today Is the Last Day of the Rest of Your Life, 2013), which tells the story of her journey through Italy as a 17-year-old. In detailed, often sketch-like drawings, she explores the topics of self-discovery, entering adulthood, and the pursuit of freedom. At the same time, she deals with the violence inflicted on her, borderline experiences, and power relations.
