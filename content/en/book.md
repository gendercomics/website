The project’s final publication provides an overview of current topics and research approaches that combine Comics Studies with Gender Studies. It opens up innovative perspectives, initiates productive discussions on gender, identity, and visual representation, and discusses intersectional/interdependent topics.

Edited by Marina Rauchenbacher, Katharina Serles, and Naomi Lobnig, with the collaboration of Susanne Hochreiter, the volume will be published as an open-access publication in the series “Comicstudien” by the renowned academic publisher de Gruyter. The publication is funded by the FWF (grant DOI [10.55776/PUB1145](https://www.fwf.ac.at/forschungsradar/10.55776/PUB1145). 
 
The chapters cover comics-specific basics, narratological and didactic issues, intermediality, superheroes, art, humor, autographics, and feminist activism, always in consideration of intersectional/interdependent topics such as gender, race, class, age, illness, and disability. 

Within the chapters, the volume offers a compilation of scientific and didactic-pedagogical analyses, supplemented by artistic approaches/comics and essayistic/student perspectives. This comprehensive and multi-perspective examination of the topics thus also follows the close interweaving of academic and artistic work in Comics Studies and pursues an innovative handbook concept that enables the research results’ dissemination beyond Comics Studies.
