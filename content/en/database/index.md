# ABOUT

The _gendercomics.net_ database brings together comics from the German-speaking world that have been selected according to the following criteria: Was the comic originally published in the German-speaking world? Does it focus on gender concepts, body norms, and related issues? Is the comic particularly informative in terms of improving understanding of the discussion around gender? Are topics such as sexuality and desire dealt with? Do other intersectional/interdependent structural categories that interact with sex/gender come into play?

The comics were selected by Susanne Hochreiter, Naomi Lobnig, Marina Rauchenbacher, Katharina Serles, and Marlene van der Werf on the basis of extensive research in archives, libraries, online, and at comic festivals/fairs in the context of the project _Visualities of Gender in German-language Comics_ funded by the Austrian Science Fund FWF (grant DOI: [10.55776/P31925](https://www.fwf.ac.at/forschungsradar/10.55776/P31925)).

The database offers a list of the selected comics with complete bibliographical details, as well as a keyword system that was developed in line with intersectional/interdependent questions. The database can be explored using a full-text search and filtered according to individual criteria (comic, person, publisher, keyword).
